# Deep-learning

projects made in python with use of Tensorflow and Keras libraries
Projects:
- GAN - GAN algorithm implemented on CIFAR-10 dataset
- Image retrival - image retrival problem made to extract 5 images with the lowest distance from the given photo (image on the left) from CIFAR-10 dataset
- mobile cifar 10 - self-made deep learning model using Mobile Net ideas, which has really good accuracy and is not computationaly expensive
